  <h3>A Taste Of What's To Come</h3>

  <!--

  A filler video. I thought about making an actual hero video, similar to the one for the Pacific Trails case study. However, I decided it wasn't worth the effort. The code required to embed an on topic video is the same as an off topic video. This video is a demonstration of a Python 3.7 program I wrote for a class final project at my previous school, The College of Wooster. It uses the turtle module to draw a circle on a square grid using Bresenham's Circle Algorithm. The code if you're interested https://pastebin.com/BcAtHC2H. I recommend running in a program like Spyder. The music is from an old YouTube video called "Music using ONLY Sounds from Windows XP and 98." https://youtu.be/dsU3B0W3TMs. Think of this as a new kind of royalty free ukulele music that you'd normally see in a hero video.
  
  The thumbnail is from the Spongebob episode "Chocolate With Nuts." I've chosen this over a still from the video for an extra poke at the elite. Same goes for the file reviewE, which is a still from the same episode. Both of these images are copyright by Viacom, who does not understand the meaning of "Fair Use." https://www.eff.org/cases/viacom-v-youtube

<!--Like the filler video, the effort required to code an on topic site is the same as code an off topic site. It would be easy to create a Facebook page for National Celeste, but using this page has an extra benefit. Since it posts something every 30 minutes, it can test if the "live feed" aspect actually works. However, all of the work writing the code was done for me, probably by an underpaid grad student intern at Facebook. It can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin.

The JavaScript version had issues with fitting inside the grid container properly. This other version, the "iframe" code, has not given me issues. However, it is considered obselete by the HTML validator we've used this semester. I believe that's Facebook's issue for providing obselete code though. Remember, this is the same textbook that asked us to use Adobe Flash, which (at the time of writing this) will be unsupported in less than 3 weeks! IFrame is obselete but embeded flash is not? This is partially why I've included the easter egg "Click to enable Flash" link and the hidden embeded text. I also will miss the era of flash games and the previous era of Shockwave games. Godspeed. -->
