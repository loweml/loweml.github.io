  <h3>Debunking Myths From Our Competitors</h3>
  
  <h4>Myth: National Celeste is an unnecessary product. It's easier to subvert the will of the people through changing public opinion. </h4>
  <h4>Reality: We believe this is from <a href="http://www.dhmo.org/">DHMO.org.</a> They pose as a research organization to inform people on the dangers of "Dihydrogen Monoxide." This is really just water. Their information is framed in a way to convince readers that this substance is dangerous. It is an effective method as long as the public doesn't ask another source. Once they find out that they've been mislead, the shift in public opinion collapses. Those who don't move back are labeled cranks. We've offered contracts to DHMO before because they've done a good job of feigning credibility. However, these contracts were rejected. National Celeste avoids the pitfall of the Dunning Kruger Effect by working directly with the news companies and big media. Whereas DHMO can be debunked quickly, every source we work with will deliver our message as fact. Surely it must be true if every organization says it is, right?</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>Myth: Public opinion requires the plurality of the population to be in agreement with you. A more effective method is mass hysteria. Now you only have to convince a fraction of the population that something radical is true, and the remaining population will fall in line and start attacking each other.</h4>
  <h4>Reality: <a href="http://www.thisman.org">This Man</a> has been a thorn in our side for many years. Their tactics are simple, since most of the heavy lifting is done by the handful of radicals they have raised. With vague beliefs that can be stretched to fit various contexts, it's very easy for the radicals to gain sympathizers. Tribal lines are drawn when the opposition comes out, and the infighting begins. However, what ThisMan.org has failed to realize that the radicals become a runaway train that can't be stopped. We refuse to work with ThisMan.org or cater to radicals, since we know we'll eventually become the radicals' next target.</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>Myth: The greater the shock, the greater the response.</h4>
  <h4>Reality: We're not entirely sure who this came from because it's a very vague statement. It is true by common sense that the harder we push on the people, the harder the people will push back. However, are they pushing back to continue the conversation, or are they trying to push the conversation out of the limelight? These hard pushes are well remembered when have an exciting climax, but they're not remembered fondly. It's more of a "I can't believe how crazy that was" way of remembering things. The cult Heavens Gate is one example of this. We admire their spiritual passion and dedication, but are shocked at their actual beliefs. Their  <a href="http://www.heavensgate.com">website</a> is littered with these frightening beliefs. Like attempting to defrost your windshield with boiling water, shocks so great destroy their own message. Success starts with a very small push.</h4>
