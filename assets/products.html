  <h4>Sly Serum</h4>
  
  <p>One of the best ways to <strike>commit crimes</strike> exercise your elite status is to find someone to do your work for you and feign ignorance. The challenge is covering up your paper trail. Our Sly Serum is going to change this forever. Its function is simple: anyone who comes in contact with the serum belives the next thing they think about is their responsbility and fills them with a powerful urge to carry it out. The applications are nearly endless, so here is just one example. Write a message on a piece of paper asking the recipient to do something, such as make a ham sandwich. Mix a few drops of the Sly Serum into water. Use a paintbrush to coat the message with this mixture. Finally, use disposable gloves to place the message in an envelope. Your unknowing accomplice will touch the serum and the next thing they'll think about is the contents of your letter. Soon you can be sure to hear reports of a ham sandwich scandal!</p>

  <h4>EZ-Sleezy Software Package</h4>
  
  <p>Our EZ-Sleezy Software Package is a one size fits all program for affecting votes in the digital world. Our competitors would have you believe their repackaged "Send to recycle bin" software is enough, but that's only one part of the equation. EZ-Sleezy can also be installed directly on voting machines, allowing you to switch votes to a dummy variable candidate or fabricate voter registration and assign them to as many new ballots as you want. Don't just delete your opponent's votes, create 100,000 votes for your candidate overnight!</p>
