  <h3>National Celeste is a nonprofit organization with a mission to create elites only democracy. We believe that the commoner has neither the money nor the intellect to decide how a country should be run. Only those with time and money to spare are capable, since we don't have to spend all day working to put food on the table.</h3>

  <h4>Who Are We?</h4>
  <p>A diverse collection of bankers, lobbyists, lawyers, and other bourgeoisie positions. Our members hail from every corner of the world's Park Avenues. Although our main offices are located in a soaring skyscraper in New York City, we have satilites operating in most financial districts around the world. This allows us to work our magic in most elections, regardless of regional scale or historical significance.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>What Do We Do?</h4>
  <p>When a client reaches out to us, our sole objective is to make clients feel enpowered. We don't just make them feel at home, every client* is given the chance to become a life member of National Celeste. This way, we're not just working for you to get things done, we're working WITH you. No middlemen and no third party motives. Now we can truly focus our money into making elites only democracy through business partnerships, luxury packages for politicians, and much more.</p>
<br>  
  
  <h4>Why Do We Do It?</h4>
  <p>Do you remember how powerless you felt when grade school bullies would steal your lunch money? What about being sent to after school detention in high school when you'd skip class. You were robbed of your right to be yourself! Your voice seemed so insignificant. A minority amongst a mob of peasants who mindlessly slaved away at their classes in the hopes of going to college or a trade school, perhaps elsewhere. You were the one free thinker, your parents had said so! Everything you asked of your parents was given to you because your free thinking was always right. It's time to take back the power. We at National Celeste have bonded together to be the free thinkers for hives on local, national, and global scales. Remember, your money is a measure of your success and intellect.</p>
