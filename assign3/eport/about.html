<h3> Academic Summary </h3>
<div class="spacerTextClass">&nbsp; </div>

<p>I recently graduated with honors from Lorem Ipsum High School right here in the great city of Indianapolis. Now I've started a CIT BS/MS 5 year program at IUPUI. Currently I have a GPA of 3.5. A more complete list of my classes and projects can be found on the resume and project pages, respectively.</p>

<h3> Outside The Classroom </h3>

<p>I'm very involved with a local robotics club and the FIRST Robotics Competition. Above you can see a sample setup from last year's contest. I also am active in a handful of student organizations for CIT and student spirit. In my free time, you might find me hiking at Eagle State Park (pictured below) or playing the piano.
